/* aimee_ir.h -- the canonical, protocol-NEUTRAL intermediate representation for
 * LLM requests/responses. FRONTEND adapters (client wire ↔ IR) and BACKEND adapters
 * (IR ↔ provider wire) both pivot through this; there is NO direct client-shape →
 * provider-shape translation. Design: docs/proposals/pending/aimee-canonical-ir.md
 * (roundtabled 2026-07-01).
 *
 * HYBRID by ruling: a typed core (semantics explicit + testable) PLUS a retained
 * `raw` cJSON sidecar on each object, so unknown provider fields survive a
 * same-protocol round-trip (a pure struct would silently drop them and break
 * prompt-cache / correctness). The typed core is the source of truth for the core
 * stages; the sidecar is for lossless same-protocol replay + observability.
 *
 * TRUST-BOUNDARY RULE: tool names + ids are OPAQUE and carried verbatim in their own
 * typed fields (never derived from the args). Tool arguments follow ruling-Q1
 * OPTION C (dual-form): the block's `raw` sidecar holds the ORIGINAL wire bytes
 * (Anthropic input object, or the OpenAI `arguments` STRING) and is AUTHORITATIVE
 * for SAME-protocol replay; `tool_input` holds the PARSED canonical cJSON object
 * (derived ONCE from raw, never independently built) used for cross-protocol
 * EQUALITY + cross-protocol backend build. The OPAQUE-byte guarantee is scoped to
 * SAME-protocol round-trips (replay raw verbatim); cross-protocol conversion
 * preserves SEMANTICS via `tool_input`, not bytes. CAVEAT: cJSON numbers are
 * doubles, so a cross-protocol re-serialize can lose precision on tool-arg integers
 * >2^53 -- prefer raw re-emit where the same-protocol fast-path applies; a
 * precision-preserving path is future work. STREAMING: accumulate raw fragments
 * only; materialize `tool_input` lazily when the block finalizes; an in-flight
 * (accumulating) tool_use is NOT IR-equal until finalized. */
